# Related Resources and Integration Testing

## Working with Relationships in Spring Data REST

- Setting relationships in Spring Data helps build Models to connect different parts of data
- It is not ideal to have all information on one table
- Depending on the type of relationship you want to create:
  - 1 to 1
  - 1 to many
  - many to many

## Integration Testing in Spring

- Need latest **junit-jupiter-engine** , **junit-jupiter-api**, and **Spring test** dependencies
- In order to test in Spring, we have to create mock environments and run pseudo routes and get the results
- Refer to the Baeldung: Spring Integration Testing for a list of testing methods
