# Custom Hooks

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe use cases for `useMemo()` and `useReducer()`

- `useMemo()`

  - is typically used for slow functions. If the state affected by a 'slow' function, then the value is reused and the slow function does not have to recompute.
  - 

- `useReducer()`

  - Is useful when a single state can change in multiple instances.
    - i.e. increase, decreasing, resetting

2. Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?

- Custom hooks do not necessairly 'need' the use prefix.. Custom hooks utilize the `use` prefix because of conventional naming. Since hooks typically start with `use` it makes sense to mimic the naming convention when creating custom hooks. Also helps in regards to readability when reviewed by other developers.

3. What do custom hooks usually do?

- Custom hooks are similar to components, in that they are dynamic, reusable, and make code modular / cleaner.

4. Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications

- react-use-form-state
- react-fetch-hook
- useMedia
- use-location

5. Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work

- Once an API request has been sent to an API, the response from that API, which might be a list, will be used to update the state to display on the app/website

## Terminology

- reducer:

  -  "It is very similar to the useState hook, just more complex. It acts as an alternate hook to the useState hook to manage complex state in your application." https://adhithiravi.medium.com/what-is-the-usereducer-hook-6274af633541#:~:text=The%20useReducer%20is%20a%20hook,as%20the%20reducers%20in%20Redux.
