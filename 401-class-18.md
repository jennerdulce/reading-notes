# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

- FIFO - first come first server basis
- Standard - Output matters more than order

2. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

- the client can assure the server by emitting an event which notifies the server

3. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

- Represented by Observer Pattern; is a software design pattern with objects
- subject maintains a list of dependencies (observers) which are notified automatically of any state changes

4. How do you test an event driven system?

- test the functionality of the handlers

## Terminology

- Serverless Functions:
  - Single-purpose, programmatic function that are hosted on managed infrastructure
  - These functions are invoked through the internet and are hosted and maintained by cloud computing companies
  - monolithic vs modularized and micro services

- Cloud Storage:
  - Cloud computing mode that stores data on the internet through a cloud computing provider who manages and operates data storage as a service

- CDN:
  - Content delievery network refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide servers which work together to provide fast delievery of internet content
  - Allows for quick transfer of assets needed for loading internet content

## Preview

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- Serverless Functions, CDN, Cloud Storage

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- How do CDN actually work?
- So we went over how to use these services, but I would like to know how to utilize every part.
  - Similar to like how we used APIs, it returns and object and we use the object however we would like
  - I would like to be comfortable with handling all of the content passed through lambda functions
- I would like to end up typing up my own lambda functions and having the knowledge to set everything up from scratch

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- Designing a full app based off of AWS!!
