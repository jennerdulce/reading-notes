# Event Driven Application

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why is access control important?

- implements a layer of security for confidential information

2. Describe an application that would need access control.modules, specifically with classes

- any app that has signup/signin capabilities
- shopping websites
- blogs

3. What is a role used for?

- dictates what users capabilities are

4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

- it is more scalable by allowing users access to confidential information, all you have to do is change their role. Other methods to perform the same action can become overly complicated

## Terminology

- Authorization:
  - allows users permissions to access to content

- Role Based Access Control:
  - method of restricting network and private information based on roles of individual users

- Capabilities:
  - a given action to users that allows individual users to perform certain tasks or access otherwise private information

## Preview

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- Roles, Auth, and Capabilities

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- Username Passwords and authentication, how user specific data is retrieved and rendered, creating a CRUD app utilizing username and password.
- I want to learn more about Events and how things change real time on other computers
- working with multiple servers on a single app

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- Real time events!
