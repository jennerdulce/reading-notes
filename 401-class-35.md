# Graphs

- Common use cases of graphs:
  - GPS and Mapping
  - Driving Directions
  - Social Networks
  - Airline Traffic
  - Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products

## Undirected vs Directed

- Undirected: A graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional
- Directed: Also called a Digraph, where every edge is directed

## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

- Complete: All verticies are connected to all other verticies
- Connected: All verticies have at least one edge
- Disconnected: Some verticies may not have edges

## Acylic vs Cylic

- Acylic: Directed graph without cycles
- Cylic: Graph that has cycles / may end up back at the start (loop)

## Graph Representation

- Adjacency Matrix: Utilizies a n x n boolean matrix with rows and columns
- Adjacency List: Similar to a hashmap

## Weight

- An edge can be given a value or 'weight' to determine a distance between two verticies

## Traversals

### Breadth First

- Enqueue the declared start node into the Queue.
- Create a loop that will run while the node still has nodes present.
- Dequeue the first node from the queue
- if the Dequeueâ€˜d node has unvisited child nodes, add the unvisited children to visited set and insert them into the queue.

### Depth First

- Push the root node into the stack
- Start a while loop while the stack is not empty
- Peek at the top node in the stack
- If the top node has unvisited children, mark the top node as visited, and then Push any unvisited children back into the stack.
- If the top node does not have any unvisited children, Pop that node off the stack
- repeat until the stack is empty.
