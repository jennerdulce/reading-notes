# Custom Hooks

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What does a component’s lifecycle refer to?

- A components lifecycle refers to the *phases* of a component which are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting

2. Why do you sometimes need to “wrap” functions in useCallback when called from within useEffect

- Some functions will continuously trigger as the App renders which is not what we want. Similar to useEffect, you can create a watcher for a specific state. This function will then run only if the state that is being watched, changes.

3. Why are functional components preferred over class components?

- Functional are easier to read and test
- Syntax leads to less code
- Speed

4. What is wrong with the following code?

```jsx
import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function changeCount(e) {
    setCount(e.target.value);
  }

  let renderedItems = []

  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    useEffect( () => {
      console.log('component mount/update');
    }, [count]);

    renderedItems.push(<div key={i}>Item</div>);
  }

  return (<div>
     <input type='number' value={count} onChange={changeCount}/>
      {renderedItems}
    </div>);
}
```

- the For loop should be within the useEffect method. The useEffect will trigger when the count changes. It is within this code block where items will be pushed into the `renderedItems` array. It only makes sense to create the array utilizing the for loop within the useEffect method

## Terminology

- state hook:

  - Used to maintain state in functional components. Ultimately allows developers to add state to a function component

- effect hook:

  - Allows developers to perform side effects upon state changes and component lifecycles

- reducer hook:

  - A different method to manage state within a component. Is useful when a single state can change in multiple instances.
    - i.e. increase, decreasing, resetting
  - Leads to cleaner code
  - Utilizes changing of state and passing the newly changed state for further use

## Preview

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- Hooks in general, lifecycles, and useCallback. Although is useCallback really important if many people do not use this?

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- Different hooks, Custom Hooks, lifecycles

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- I am excited about digging deeper into React.. Its challenging but I am determined to get it down!
