# Routing

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?

- Child components do not have direct access to props/state from the parent. Child components are only allowed to access what the parents GIVE the child.

2. When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered?

- The child component's output gets rendered as usual.
- In addition to this, the child's output can also be accessed by using this.props.children within the component that is acting as the wrapper

3. Can a component, such as , which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?

- Yes, any component besides the app component can typically be used anywhere else.

4. What trick can a parent use to share all props with it’s children

- Yes! You can do this by simply spreading the props within a component
`<SomeComponent {...props} />`

## Terminology

- props.children:
  - This is the syntax to access the children of a wrapper component

- composition:
  - React development pattern
  - Prevents us from building too many similar components that contain duplicate code
  - Builds out fewer components that can be used at multiple areas of the app
