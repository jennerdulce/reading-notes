# Inheritance Day 2

- During the lab, I didn't use interfaces nor inherit them.
- I do not understand why we would use them because Classes seem so much better.
- I also watched a video saying that interfaces are nearly useless

```java
    public Review(String body, String author, int stars, Restaurant restaurant){
        this.body = body;
        this.author = author;
        if(stars < 0 || stars > 5){
          throw new IllegalArgumentException(e){
            sout("Must input a number greater than 0 or less than 5")
          }
        }
        this.stars = (float) stars;
        this.restaurant = restaurant.name;
    }

    // Testing for assertions
    @Test void bad_review(){
      Review sut = new Review("something", "Chilis", 999, 5)
      assertThrows(typeOfException(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> sut = Review sut = new Review("something", "Chilis", 999, 5))
    }
```
