# Application State with Redux

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”

- https / http tags differ and may cause problems when working with Cookies
- Cookies are server-side
- Cookie has a 4096 byte limit
- Local Storage can only be read client-side
- Local Storage has 5mb per domain

2. Explain 3rd party cookies.

- Also known as 'trackers', 3rd party cookies collect user data for a third party and are set by someone other than the owner of the primary website a customer/user visits.

3. How do pixel tags work?

- Single pixel, transparent GIF images that are added to a webpages and is a way to track user behavior.
- Advertisers utilize pixel tags to acquire data for online marketing, web analysis, and other analytical tools.

## Terminology

- cookies:

  - Text files that are stored on a browser that contain small pieces of data and is used to 'improve your web browsing experience'

- authorization:

  - A layer of security that is typically used to verify a user before allowing them to use the application

- access control:

  - Where authorization defines what a person can access, access controls (permissions or privileges) are methods we use to enforce such policies

- conditional rendering:

  - Used conjunction with auth, this process renders code based on a condition to be met (typically a boolean)
