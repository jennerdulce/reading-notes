# Serverless and Amplify

## Serverless

> *"Focus on your application, not the infrastructure"*

- Serverless is a cloud computing execution model
- Could provider dynamically manages allocation and provisioning of servers
- No dedicated server running
- Stateless and is event-triggered
- Pricing based on numebr of executions rather than pre-purchased compute capacity
- Better Pricing
- Scalable
- Event-Triggered
- Stateless
- Faster Setup
- Fosters Innovation

- Cons:
  - Cannot access directly  through usual API
  - Can only be accessed by private APIs
  - Security Risk
  - Cost in unpredictable
    - Number of executions is not predefinied like how traditional servers are

- List of cloud services:
  - AWS Lambda
  - Google Cloud Functions
  - Azure Functions
  - IBM OpenWhisk
  - Alibaba Function Compute
  - Iron Functions
  - Auth0 Webtask
  - Oracle Fn Project
  - Kubeless

## AWS Amplify

> *"AWS Amplify is a set of purpose-built tools and services that makes it quick and easy for front-end web and mobile developers build full-stack applications on AWS, with the flexibility to leverage the breadth of AWS services to further customize applications. Amplify supports popular languages, frameworks, and platforms, including JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue, and Next.js for web apps and Android, iOS, React Native, Ionic, and Flutter for mobile apps."*

- Serverless app hosting
- Fast Setup

## GraphQL

> *"The GraphQL Transform provides a simple to use abstraction that helps you quickly create backends for your web and mobile applications on AWS. With the GraphQL Transform, you define your application's data model using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) and the library handles converting your SDL definition into a set of fully descriptive AWS CloudFormation templates that implement your data model."*

- Works in conjunction with AWS Amplify to quickly create backends.
- Assits in building a data model you use for your app

> *"The GraphQL Transform simplifies the process of developing, deploying, and maintaining GraphQL APIs. With it, you define your API using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) and can then use automation to transform it into a fully descriptive cloudformation template that implements the spec. The transform also provides a framework through which you can define your own transformers as @directives for custom workflows."*
