# Event Driven Architecture

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

- FIFO - first come first server basis
- Standard - Output matters more than order

2. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

- the client can assure the server by emitting an event which notifies the server

3. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

- Represented by Observer Pattern; is a software design pattern with objects
- subject maintains a list of dependencies (observers) which are notified automatically of any state changes

4. How do you test an event driven system?

- test the functionality of the handlers

## Terminology

- FIFO Queue:
  - messaging apps when the order of operations and events are critical
  - useful for organising and manupliation of data
  - analagous to serving people in a first come first serve bases

- Pub/Sub:
  - publisher app creates and sends messages to a topic
  - sub apps create a subscription to a topic to receive messages from it
  - async massaging services

## Preview

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- Pub, sub and Sending of messages

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- I want to dig deeper on how disconnection/what happens when a system turns off and turns back on and how to handle it
- I want to dig depper into Pub and Sub concepts
- Understand implementation of queues and optimal usages

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- Building better apps and optimal code
