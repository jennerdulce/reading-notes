# BCrypt

> *"The gist of authentication is to provide users with a set of credentials, such as username and password, and to verify that they provide the correct credentials whenever they want access to the application. "*
- Storing passwords is risky. You shouldn't store a password without secuirty
- Hashing is a way to encrypt your password. It is nearly impossible to break through it without knowing the exact password
  - Using a hashing algorithm to change the password
  - Hashing is always different
  - A same password can have a different hash
  - Salting is a term used that hashes a password a certain amount of times

- Heres hashing in a nutshell:

```java
// Hash a password for the first time
String hashed = BCrypt.hashpw(password, BCrypt.gensalt());

// gensalt's log_rounds parameter determines the complexity
// the work factor is 2**log_rounds, and the default is 10
String hashed = BCrypt.hashpw(password, BCrypt.gensalt(12));

// Check that an unencrypted password matches one that has
// previously been hashed
if (BCrypt.checkpw(candidate, hashed))
	System.out.println("It matches");
else
	System.out.println("It does not match");
```
