# Espresso

> *"Espresso is targeted at developers, who believe that automated testing is an integral part of the development lifecycle. While it can be used for black-box testing, Espressoâ€™s full power is unlocked by those who are familiar with the codebase under test."*

## Espresso Test Recorder

- Andriod studios has a built in Test Recorder that records your interaction with your application and creates test based on your actions that you perform while using your app.
- Tests consist of UI Interactions and assertions on View Elements
- To start recording a test with Espresso Test Recorder, proceed as follows:

1. Click Run > Record Espresso Test.
2. In the Select Deployment Target window, choose the device on which you want to record the test. If necessary, create a new Android Virtual Device. Click OK.
3. Espresso Test Recorder triggers a build of your project, and the app must install and launch before Espresso Test Recorder allows you to interact with it. The Record Your Test window appears after the app launches, and since you have not interacted with the device yet, the main panel reads "No events recorded yet." Interact with your device to start logging events such as "tap" and "type" actions.

- Types of assertions:
  1. text is
  2. exists
  3. does not exist

- To add an assertion to your test, proceed as follows:

1. Click Add Assertion. A Screen Capture dialog appears while Espresso gets the UI hierarchy and other information about the current app state. The dialog closes automatically once Espresso has captured the screenshot.
2. A layout of the current screen appears in a panel on the right of the Record Your Test window. To select a View element on which to create an assertion, click on the element in the screenshot or use the first drop-down menu in the Edit assertion box at the bottom of the window. The selected View object is highlighted in a red box.
3. Select the assertion you want to use from the second drop-down menu in the Edit assertion box. Espresso populates the menu with valid assertions for the selected View element.
If you choose the "text is" assertion, Espresso automatically inserts the text currently inside the selected View element. You can edit the text to match your desired assertion using the text field in the Edit assertion box.
4. Click Save and Add Another to create another assertion or click Save Assertion to close the assertion panels.
