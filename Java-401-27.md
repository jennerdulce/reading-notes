# Intents, Activities, and SharedPreferences

- Task: Stack of activities
- These activities are arranged in a *stack* in the order when each is opened.
- Push / Pop model
- Hitting home = whole task is put into background
  - Selecting app is brought back to foreground
- Single Top?
- Back button should not cross into different tasks
- Back button should pop last entry off of the backstack
- TaskStackBuilder?

- You can save key-values by using the `SharedPreferences` API
- Can be privated or shared

- Create new share dpreference file or access one

- `getSharedPreferences()` — Use this if you need multiple shared preference files identified by name, which you specify with the first parameter. You can call this from any **Context**in your app.

- `getPreferences()` — Use this from an **Activity** if you need to use only one shared preference file for the activity. Because this retrieves a default shared preference file that belongs to the activity, you don't need to supply a name.

- Give your shard preference fiels a  unique name
  - An easy way to do this is prefix the file name with your application ID. For example: `com.example.myapp.PREFERENCE_FILE_KEY`
  - `SharedPreferences sharedPref = getActivity().getPreferences(Context.MODE_PRIVATE);`

- To write to a shared preferences file, create a `SharedPreferences.Editor` by calling `edit()` on your `SharedPreferences`.

```java
SharedPreferences sharedPref = getActivity().getPreferences(Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
SharedPreferences.Editor editor = sharedPref.edit();
editor.putInt(getString(R.string.saved_high_score_key), newHighScore);
editor.apply();
```

- `.apply()` changes inmemory object immediately and writes update to disk ASYNCHRONOUSLY
- `.commit()` writes data to dick synchrnously
  - Avoid calling this in your main thread, it may pause UI rendering..
