# OO Design

## [Don’t Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

> *"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system"*
> *Additionally, elements that are logically related all change predictably and uniformly, and are thus kept in sync*

## [Rule of Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming))

> *"It states that two instances of similar code do not require refactoring, but when similar code is used three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure"*
> *"The rule implies that the cost of maintenance certainly outweighs the cost of refactoring and potential bad design when there are three copies, and may or may not if there are only two copies"*

## [You Aren’t Gonna Need It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)\

> *"Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them." - XP co-founder Ron Jeffries*

## [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)

- Completion of a product functional enough to be used by customers
- Also known as Alpha during early stages of development
- Deems prodcuct is usable but not entirely finished or refined
