# Stacks and Queues

## Stacks: LIFO

- liner data structure
- inserted and deleted from one side of the list known as the `top`
- Useful when order of actions is important
- ensures that a sytem does not move onto a new action before completing those before
- common uses: reversing, callstack
- insertion: `.push()`
- deletion: `.pop()`
- **recursion**

## Queues: FIFO

- liner data structure
- can only insert from rear
- deleted from the front
- insertion: `.enqueue()`
- deletion: `.dequeue()`
- maintains 2 pointers: `front` and `rear`
- **sequential processing**
