# Linked Lists

- Linked List: *"A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link."*

- Linear data structure
- Array vs Linked lists
  - Arrays need certain amounts of memory
  - Linked lists are more dynamic

- Two types: Singly and Doubly
- Singly
  - Each node only has 1 reference: next
- Doubly
  - Each node has 2 references: next and previous
- Node
  - Individual items/links which contains data for each lin
- Next
  - Each node has a property called next that points to the next node
- Head
  - References to the beginning of the linked list
- Current
  - A reference to identify which node you are currently on when traversing the linked list
- Tail
  - Last node that points to null

- Best way to apporach a linked list is (while current)
  - Means that while there are items in the linked list
- It is common for linked lists to have their on methods to perform actions on the linked list
  - Remove, add, contains, etc..
