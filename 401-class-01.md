## Describe (in plain English) what Array.map() does
  - `.map()` with this array method, developers are able to iterate through an array that executes a callback and pick specific types of information that they want. This array method also creates a new array that is taken from the original. The original array remains the same and untouched.

## Describe (in plain English) what Array.reduce() does
  - `.reduce()` array method, developers are able to iterate through an array, that executes a call back to run by each iteration. `.reduce()` has 2 main parameters: 'accumulator' and 'value'. value being the current iteration/value. the accumulator is a value that is remembered/brought forth after each iteration and can be used toward each interation in sequence. `.reduce()` typically results in a single output.

## Provide code snippets showing how to use superagent() to fetch data from a URL and log the result
## With normal Promise .then() syntax
```
// import superagent
const superagent = require('superagent')

// install superagent in terminal
npm install superagent

superagent.get(`some API url`)
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data.body)
  })
  .catch(err => console.error(err)
```

## Again with async / await syntax
```
async function someName() {
  try {
    let data = await superagent.get(`some API url`)
    console.log(data.body)
    
  } catch(error) {
     console.error(error)
  }
}
```
## Explain promises as though you were mentoring a Code 301 level student
- Think of a promise as a promise in an event in real life. Imagine if one of your parents PROMISE to give you a cookie after they are DONE working. We can infer that you will get the cookie later.. This happens the same in code when working with code asynchronously. When asynchronous (parent) code runs, it needs time to execute (working) and give you a result (cookie/promise). While the asynchrnous code is running, your program continues to run other code down your file. When your asynchronous code is finished (done working), the output or data given back to you is known as a PROMISE. In other words promise is THE DATA given back to you after an asynchronous call.

## Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not?
- From my understanding, not all callback functions are asynchronous. You can run callback functions to perform actions that do not need to be ran asynchronously..
