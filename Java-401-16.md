# Spring Authentication

- Boils down to two problems..
  1. Who are you?
  2. What are you allowed to do?

- Authentication Manager does 3 things
  1. Return an Authentication true if it can verify input is valid
  2. AuthenticationException
  3. null

> *"Sometimes, an application has logical groups of protected resources (for example, all web resources that match a path pattern, such as /api/**), and each group can have its own dedicated AuthenticationManager. Often, each of those is a ProviderManager, and they share a parent. The parent is then a kind of “global” resource, acting as a fallback for all providers."*

- If authentication is successful, move on to authorization.
- Use of filters to help web security


## Customizing Authentication Managers

- Spring Security has configs to better set up in your application
