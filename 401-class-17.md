# AWS: S3 and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

- FIFO - first come first server basis
- Standard - Output matters more than order

2. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

- the client can assure the server by emitting an event which notifies the server

3. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

- Represented by Observer Pattern; is a software design pattern with objects
- subject maintains a list of dependencies (observers) which are notified automatically of any state changes

4. How do you test an event driven system?

- test the functionality of the handlers

## Terminology

- Server Instances:
  - A server instance is a collection of SQL Server Databases which are run by a solitary SQL server or instance

- Containers:
  - A standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another

- Cloud Services:
  - Wide range of servicces delievered on demand to companies and customers over the internet
  - designed to provide easy, and affordable access to applications and resources without the need for internal infrastruture or hardware

- Cloud Architecture:
  - How individual technologies are integrated to create clouds/cloud services
  - IT environments that abstract pool and share scalable resources across a network

- AWS:
  - Amazon Web Services
  - A platform that offers flexible, reliable, scalable, easy-to-uses and cost-effective cloud computing solutions

- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku:
  - Elactic Compute Cloud
    - Web service that provides secure, resizeable computer capacity iin the cloud
    - designed to make web-scale cloud computing easy for developers
  - Beanstalk
    - easy to use-service for deploying and scaling web applications and services
    - Simply upload code to beanstalk
      - Beanstalk automatically handles depolyment
  - Heroku
    - Lots of setup to update server/app

## Preview

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- Cloud Services and Architecture, Containers, and Server Instances

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- I still do not clearly understand the different parts of what we are working with.
- Need to read more of Server Instances and examples
- Need to read more of Containers

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- REACT!!!
