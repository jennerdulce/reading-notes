# Trees

- Multiple types of trees

- Binary Trees:
  - No Order
- Binary Search Trees
  - Ordered
  - Nodes left of root are less than root
  - Node to the right are greater
- Kary Trees
  - Children Nodes

- Tree components
  - Left: node to the left
  - Right: node to the right
  - Edge: the link between nodes
  - Leaf: node with no children (left or right)
  - Height: how far away from root

## Traversals

- Depth first
  - In order: left >> root >> right
  - Pre order: root >> left >> right
  - Post order: left >> right >> root
- Breadth First
