# Ethics in Tech

## Ethics in Workplace

- This artical reminded me of the social dilemma.
- It's scary.
- It is also interesting how many do not know about how our personal information is being handled and that we are a commodity.
- Even I know this information and I do not bat an I when I think I should.
- Anywho, its a hard pill to swallow and I think it is unfortunate that there aren't any protocols to stop these acts
- Although we "allow" applications to use our data because we agreed to the fine print, I think if it was more clear on what might happen to our identity upon agreement.. Like the actual RAW, dark side, of monitization and corruptness of it all. A lot of people would think otherwise.

## Ethics in Technology

- [Self-Driving car](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2017/11/21/self-driving-cars-ethics/804805001/)

- I've come across this topic a couple of times and my mind has come to one conclusion.
- If this technology were to ever come to a point of choosing who should live or die.. We should not implment that technology.
- Self driving cars aren't a necessity.
- Innovation is great sure, but the human race is getting lazier and lazier.
- I belive that the person who write code such as this should be held held responsible and the company should be charged with second degree murder. Just because this type of technology IS NOT A NECESSITY.
- A situation like this is literally telling the program to kill someone at moments notice.
