# Props and State

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Does a deployed React application require a server?

- A deployed React application does indeed require a server

2. Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?

- Its important to test React at the behavior because testing React apps is very different. You test React apps by creating mock inputs, receiving, and performing mock events.

3. What does npm run build do?

- NPM run build creates a 'build' folder that contains documents inorder to deploy a server

4. Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application

- index.js contains an APP componenet
- App component typically contains other components to build out web pages
- There is only 1 Component that is rendered from the index.js and that is the App Component
- Babel transcribes JSX into JavaScript
- Web Page is rendered

## Terminology

- BDD:
  - Behavior Driven Development
  - Type of app testing that encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the app should behave.
  
- Acceptance Tests:
  - Testing technique to determine whether or not the software system has met the requirement specification.
  - Evaluates the system's compliance with the business requirements and verify if it meets the requried criteria for deliever to end users.

- mounting:
  - The process of creating instances and DOM nodes corresponding to React components, and inserting them into the DOM, is called mounting.

- build:
  - Version of a React app that is optimally condensed for server deployment

## Preview

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- BDD, Servers and React, Server Deployment

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- I hope to understand React Testing, Mounting, and Babel.. should I as a developer dig into the world of Babel?

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- I want to see how important mounting is and where it comes into play
