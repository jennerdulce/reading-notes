1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)

- Angular, Vue, Svelte, Webix, and Sencha

2. Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?

- Frameworks are applications themselvs that help users develop an application in its entireity.
- Frameworks can be referred to as a skeleton application where a user defines the content of operation by filling out the skeleton
- A Library provides a set of helper functions and objects which call for specific functionality.

## Terminology
