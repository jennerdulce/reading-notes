  1. Database class
  2. Data entities

## Relationships between objects

- Two possible approaches
  1. Model relationship using intermediate data class with embedded objects
  2. Relational query method with a multimap return type

- Intermediate Approach
  - Allows you to avoid writing complex SQL queries
  - Can also  result in increased code complexity due to additional classes it requires

- Multimap
  - Requires more SQL queries

- DAOs access your apps database
- Two types of DAO methods that define database interaction
