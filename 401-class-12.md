# Event Driven Application

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?

- Complete file does not have to be downloaded in order to receive output.
- User can immediately start viewing data even though the complete file has not been transferred over. (Streaming services)

2. UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?

- UDP does not require a virtural circut to be established before any data transfer occurs

3. Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?

- Yes, a single port can accept 1 or more connections simultaneously

4. Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?

- No, it Cannot

5. Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?

- Yes, I suppose so... The connections would be distinguished by a new variable with a different port or port endpoint

## Terminology

- Observer Pattern:
  - Design pattern used for one-to-many relationships
  - if one object is modified, its dependent relationships are mentioned automatically

- Listener:
  - a code block that is activated by a trigger

- Event Handler:
  - block of code (typically a callback) that is ran when the event is called upon

- Event Driven Programming:
  - programming paradigm where flow of program is determined by events/actions that trigger correlating code

- Event Loop:
  - monitors call stack and call back queue
  - if call stack is empty, event loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the callstack

- Event Queue:
  - design pattern of a queue of events awaiting to be processed by a program

- Call Stack:
  - a collection of code to be ran
  - FILO pushes and pops items off a stack

- Emit/Raise/Trigger:
  - an alarm that when alarmed will actiave/run corresponding code

- Subscribe:
  - an instance when a person/program decides to make a connection to pass each other data

- Database:
  - a structured collection of data that can be accessed, modified, and managed


## Preview
