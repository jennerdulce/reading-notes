# Component Composition

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Can a parent component access the state of a child component?

- Yes you can, I believe parents can only read this information by creating a function to and passing that function as a prop to the child in which the child component utilizes in order to pass state to the parent.

2. What can be passed along in a prop variable?

- Any data type, state, strings, numbers etc

3. How can a child component “know” the state of another component?

- State must be passed from the Parent component to the child component. There is no other way to "know" state values
- Child components cannot see that state of other child components

## Terminology

- component props:
  - Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
  
- component state:
  - React components has a built-in state object.
  - The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.

- application state:
  - "Application state is a data repository available to all classes. Application state is stored in memory on the server and is faster than storing and retrieving information in a database. Unlike session state, which is specific to a single user session, application state applies to all users and sessions. Therefore, application state is a useful place to store small amounts of often-used data that does not change from one user to another." - Shree
