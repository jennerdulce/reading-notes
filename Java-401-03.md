# Maps, primitives, File I/O

## [Primitives vs. Objects](https://www.baeldung.com/java-primitives-vs-objects)

> *"Java has a two-fold type system consisting of primitives such as int, boolean and reference types such as Integer, Boolean. Every primitive type corresponds to a reference type.*
> *Every object contains a single value of the corresponding primitive type. The wrapper classes are immutable (so that their state can't change once the object is constructed) and are final (so that we can't inherit from them)."*

- Objects in java are slower and have bigger memory impact than primitives
  - Footprint for primitives is smaller
- Decision on what object you should use is mainly basedon application performance
  - How much memory
  - Default Values
  - Ignore if you have no limitations
- Performance of Java code depends very much on hardware that the code runs on

## [Exceptions in Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/index.html)

- Exception: An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.
- Use of excepions help to manage erros and have advantages over error-management techniques. However they both do the same thing, handle erros
- Ways to handle errors using exceptions
  - Throw Exceptions
    1. Checked: well-written application should anticpate and recover from
    2. Error: happen external to the application
    3. Runtime: programming bugs, logic errors, improper usage of API
  - Try Catch Finally
  - Specify Requirements
- Most programs you write will throw and catch Exceptions as opposed to Errors.

> *"Do not throw a RuntimeException or create a subclass of RuntimeException simply because you don't want to be bothered with specifying the exceptions your methods can throw."*
> *"Here's the bottom line guideline: If a client can reasonably be expected to recover from an exception, make it a checked exception. If a client cannot do anything to recover from the exception, make it an unchecked exception.*"

### Throwing exceptions

```java
public Object pop() {
    Object obj;

    if (size == 0) {
        throw new EmptyStackException();
    }

    obj = objectAt(size - 1);
    setObjectAt(size - 1, null);
    size--;
    return obj;
}
```

### Creating Own exceptions

- [Reference here to create you own exceptions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/creating.html)

- *"The pop method checks to see whether any elements are on the stack. If the stack is empty (its size is equal to 0), pop instantiates a new EmptyStackException object (a member of java.util) and throws it."*

## [Using Scanner to read in a file in Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/scanning.html)

- Scanner are useful for breaking down formatted input into tokens and translating tokens to their data type
- Input >> Tokens
- Scanner uses whitespace to separate tokens
