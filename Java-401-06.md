# Arrays, Loops, Imports

## [Java OO Tutorial (review Object and Class, read the rest)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/) & [Java Inheritance & Interfaces Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/index.html)

### Inheritance

- Inheritance: Classes inherit state and behavior from their superclasses
- Classes *inherit* state and behavior from other classes.
  - Subclasses have access to state and behavior of their parent class

### Interface

- Interface: contract between a class and the outside world.
  - When a class implements an interface, it promises to provide the behavior published by that interface.
- *"Methods from the object's interface with the ourside world"*
- Interfaces form a contact between the class and the outside world.

### Package

- Package: A namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner.
  - Makes project easier to manage
  - Application Programming Interface (API)
- Similar to different folders on your ocmputer
- i.e.
  - You might keep HTML pages in one folder
  - Images in a different folder
  - Scrips in a different folder etc..
- It makes sense to keep things organized by placing related classes and interfaces into packages
- The Java language has a built in class library known as the "Application Programming Interface" (API)
