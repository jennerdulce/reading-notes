# HOOKS API

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?

- While using React, you arent actually usingany html documents.. you are actually using JSX. The reason why this doesnt require more html pages is because JSX works by changing the contents of the single page.

2. If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?

- If you wanted a component to show up on every page, such as a Header or Footer, you would want to put it OUTSIDE a <Route /> tag. Only certain content is rendered by accessing a route. Putting it outside a route tag will render no matter what route you are on.

4. What does props.children contain?

- props.children can be accessed within a 'wrapper' component.
- The value of props.children are the contents that are wrapped around a 'wrapper' component
Terminology

## Terminology

- Composition:

  - React development pattern
  - Prevents us from building too many similar components that contain duplicate code
Builds out fewer components that can be used at multiple areas of the app

- Children / Child Components:

  - A child component is any component that is used within another component
  - This can be confused with the contents within a Wrapper Component, where the children are what the Wrapper Component Wrap around

- Hash Routing:

  - "HashRouter uses a hash symbol in the URL, which has the effect of all subsequent URL path content being ignored in the server request (ie you send "www.mywebsite.com/#/person/john" the server gets "www.mywebsite.com". As a result the server will return the pre # URL response, and then the post # path will be handled by parsed by your client side react application." - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51974369/what-is-the-difference-between-hashrouter-and-browserrouter-in-react

- Link Routing:

  - "BrowserRouter will not append the # symbol to your URL, however will create issues when you try to link to a page or reload a page. If the explicit route exists in your client react app, but not on your server, reloading and linking(anything that hits the server directly) will return 404 not found errors." - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51974369/what-is-the-difference-between-hashrouter-and-browserrouter-in-react
