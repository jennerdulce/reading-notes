# AWS: Events

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

- FIFO - first come first server basis
- Standard - Output matters more than order

2. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

- the client can assure the server by emitting an event which notifies the server

3. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

- Represented by Observer Pattern; is a software design pattern with objects
- subject maintains a list of dependencies (observers) which are notified automatically of any state changes

4. How do you test an event driven system?

- test the functionality of the handlers

## Terminology

- Serverless API:
  - Cloud computing executing model where a cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation provisioning of Servers

- Triggers:
  - Triggers are procedures that are stored in the database and are implicitly run or fired when something happens

- Dynamo Vs. Mongo:
  - Dynamo
    - AWS tied database that is similar to MongoDB with some restrictions
  - Mongo
    - Database that has less restrictions and is flexible
  - Both are Document Database Architectures

- Dynamoose Vs. Mongoose:
  - Object Data Modeling
  - Both are node packages that contain methods to perform actions on their respective databases
  - Dynamoose
    - is used in conjunction with a DynamoDB to perform CRUD actions
  - Mongoose
    - is used in conjunction with a MongoDB to perform CRUD actions
  

## Preview

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- Serverless API, API , DynamoDB/Dynamoose and MongoDB/Mongoose

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- I want to know use cases of relational vs document databases
- I want to learn most AWS tools
- Is serverless really the future?

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- Designing a full app based off of AWS!
